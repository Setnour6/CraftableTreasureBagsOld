# CraftableTreasureBags

A Terraria modification that allows you to craft Treasure Bags in NORMAL MODE! This makes the game easier.


Have you ever wanted to get expert mode exclusive boss drops in normal mode? Well now you can, with Craftable Treasure Bags. This mod allows you to get expert mode items in normal mode, from crafting boss treasure bags and opening them right in normal mode!

This mod contains recipes for all vanilla boss treasure bags (Not including bosses/minibosses from the Old One's Army).
All treasure bags are to be crafted with an empty treasure bag at a Demon Altar. Make sure to also have the boss summoning item (some recipes may require other items instead of boss summoning items).
Craft an empty treasure bag with 10 silk at a loom.
Craft a boss treasure bag with boss loot and the respective boss summon item (some other recipes require different items as well besides boss loot only).
Some modded recipes do not use boss summon items to make the treasure bag.

As of version 0.14, This mod includes modded treasure bag recipes for the following mods:
- AlchemistNPC
- Ancients Awakened
- Azercadmium
- Calamity
- Elements Awoken
- Enigma
- Joost
- Mod of Redemption
- Pinkymod
- Qwerty's Bosses and Items
- Shadows of Abaddon
- Spirit
- Split
- Thorium
- Ultranium

*Updates will be __less frequent__ due to real life complications.*

Q: "Why are there multiple treasure bag recipes popping up?"
A: I know this is an indirect answer, but if I were to use recipe groups, it can possibly crash the game. I've tested it multiple times and the game crashed a lot. I will not be using recipe groups, sadly.
